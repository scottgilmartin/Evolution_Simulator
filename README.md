# What is this?
Evolution/ artificial selection simulator, inspired by Heikegani crabs. 
From the wikipedia article:
"...according to this hypothesis, the crabs with shells resembling Samurai were thrown back to the sea by fishermen out of respect for the Heike warriors, while those not resembling Samurai were eaten, giving the former a greater chance of reproducing. 
Thus, the more closely the crabs resembled a samurai face, the more likely they would be spared and thrown back."

# How does it work?
To simulate this, we generate sprites based on mutations of an original 'DNA' matrix. Then click the sprite that looks most like a face in each generation, 
the next generation will use the DNA of the selecion to generate similar mutations. 
In this way we can progressively make the sprite look more like a face with each generation.
